TestController:
    - Global data improvements
        - Add a method to write test data to a file
            - TestController.write_test_data(file: string, test: TestBase = None, iteration: int = None)
            - Write a json formatted string to a file, with path @file, containing the global test data
            - If the path to that file does not exist, create it
            - Optional @test parameter to signal that only the data for that test should be written
            - Optional @iteration parameter to signal that only data for that iteration should be written
