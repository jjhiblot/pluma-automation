This all documentation, and code is currently under development, and may be subject to change, so use caution.

A draft coding guide for developers can be found at [/docs/style-guide.md](/docs/style-guide.md). This is in development still, but better than nothing.

A lot of the other documentation (maybe all!) is depreciated now, so don't rely on it for trustworthy information.
